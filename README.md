# Week 12 Lab Report -- Bike Share Data
**Zoey Dangleman**

This repository is focused on creating a set of functions that a bike manager can use to identify optimal bike placement based on bike usage data. It creates an estimation of the arrival rates, simulates placements, and measures happiness of riders. It presents plots on the bike usage behaviors, the proposed placement strategy, the outcome of the strategy, and insight on the daily inventory dynamics. 

The function of each script is described in its code. All scripts will be sourced and ran via the run_analysis.R script.
